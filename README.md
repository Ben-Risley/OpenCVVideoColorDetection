# OpenCVVideoColorDetection
Detects color based on the values of hue, saturation, and vibrancy from the OpenCV's inRange() function. The values hue, saturation, and vibrancy, can 
be calibrated to correspond to a given color. All fundamental colors (ROY G BIV) can be assigned to their own coordinates of hue saturation and vibrancy
and simultaneously detected and labeled by the webcam.
